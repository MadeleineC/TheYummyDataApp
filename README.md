Project Description:
We provide restauranteurs the ability to find the best zip codes/areas in their market to expand or launch their businesses. Our map/product allows clients the ability to identify the best areas in their target market on their own, or provides users with the feedback necessary with just a few simple clicks. 
Our map would be filterable using
•	type of cuisine
•	target markets they are considering (city & states)
•	anticipated average order value (price)
•	median income in the area
•	average restaurant rating by cuisine, by zip code


Visualizations:


One map, two layers with the ability to toggle on/off. Layer one would show a heat map showing the population density, layer two would show a cluster map showing restaurant count. Data populating below for user to see the data populate as they interact with the map.
